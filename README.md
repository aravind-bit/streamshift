What this app does

Buyer / Target selectors — pick a hypothetical deal to explore.

Rippleboard — plain-English predictions for each title’s landing status plus a concise note.

IP Similarity Map — TF-IDF + PCA to cluster titles by audience DNA (skips gracefully if scikit-learn isn’t installed).

Originals from the target — highlights first-party titles; if metadata is thin, we infer from platform/network so the table isn’t blank.

Sources / Traceability — shows your saved source URLs; if missing, provides a TMDB search link so you can verify quickly.
